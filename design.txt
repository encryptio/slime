Slime stores small files (<64MB) redundantly over a set of filesystems and
exposes them over a RESTful API.

It is built out of 3 main pieces:
    - The proxy server, which handles redundancy and error recovery
    - The chunk servers, which handle storing data and checking for bitrot
    - The metadata database, which stores information about what files exist
      and where their chunks can be found.

Chunk dir structure:
    $DIR/
        uuid
        data/
            ...chunks...
        quarantine/
            ...bad chunks...

Chunks are stored as a 64-bit FNV-1a hash of the data (8 bytes) followed by the
data. Chunks that are found to not validate via this header hash are
quarantined for later inspection by a sysadmin.
